## About

My name is Longkun Xu, people also call me Luke. 

I am currently an engineer at SAIT China lab, Samsung Electronics, where I am working on the intersection of AI, HPC and computational material science to design materials used in Samsung products, e.g., battery, display and semiconductors materials. I obtained my PhD degree at the Australian National University in 2022.

I have 7 years experience (2015-2022) with computational chemistry and also have hands-on experience with machine learning and academic publishing industry. I am familiar with Python, SQL, R, Julia, web data, high performance computing, neural network potential, etc.

I have a wide spectrum of research interests related with using computational science, AI and HPC to solve real-world pratical problems within and beyond the domain of chemistry, e.g., battery and material design, drug discovery and retrosynthesis, etc. Here's my [CV](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/longkunxuluke.github.io/blob/master/LongkunXU_CV.pdf) and [简历](https://github.com/longkunxuluke/longkunxuluke.github.io/blob/master/%E5%BE%90%E9%BE%99%E5%9D%A4_%E7%AE%80%E5%8E%86.pdf).

You can find my blog posts [here](https://longkunxuluke.github.io/year-archive/), which are some tutorials used to answer questions I have been frequently asked, feel free to let me know your comments and questions.You can contact me via longkunx@gmail.com
