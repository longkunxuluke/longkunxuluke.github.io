## About Me *(Updated: 7-Sep-2025)*

My name is Longkun Xu, people also call me Luke. Currently I am an AI algorithm engineer at Ecoflow, working with [Dr. Rui Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V-21UXUAAAAJ&hl=en) on self-evolving agents.

Previously I worked for Samsung R&D Institute China - Beijing (SRC-B, with [Dr. Qiang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rhuzgdgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) on data-efficient AI4S methods including machine learning potentials and molecular generation) and Dongyangguang New Energy Research Institute (HEC, working on scientific images process with computer vision techniques, smart manufacturing and optimization, high-throughput molecular screening and generation, and multi-scale multi-physics simulation).

I earned my PhD in computational chemistry at the Australian National University in 2022,
under the supervision of [Prof. Michelle Coote](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TiX18tcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My PhD thesis is on developing more accurate solvation models and studying complex electrostatic environment.

I have published 10+ papers in journals including JACS, Nature Communication,
JCTC, JPCL, JPCC, JPCA. My research was highlighted in AI for Science Global Outlook 2023 Edition,
EurekAlert!, PHYS.ORG, Chemistry in Australia. I server as a reviewer for AI conferences ICLR (2025),
ICML(2023, 2024), NeurIPS(2022, 2023) and chemical journals including JCTC and JPCA.

You can find my blog posts [here](https://longkunxuluke.github.io/year-archive/), which are some tutorials used to answer questions I have been frequently asked, feel free to let me know your comments and questions. You can contact me via longkunx@gmail.com
