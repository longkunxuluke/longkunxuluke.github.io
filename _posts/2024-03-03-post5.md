This post will talk about how to create a conda environment and use it in a machine without internet.

First, we need to download a conda program at the machine you are using with internet, see [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).

Then, we create an environment with target pytorch and CUDA version that are matched with our GPU model. For example, we can install pytorch==1.11.0 and CUDA=11.3 by runnung ```conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch```, see [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)

In China mainland, we might need to use a local conda channels, see [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/616918130).

After install all packages, we can check pytorch and CUDA version by 

```
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
print(torch.version.cuda)
print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

Then we can pack our conda environment into a file by ```conda pack -n [the name of your environment]```, we might need to install the ```pack``` command by ```conda install conda-pack``` (see [here](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/)), we might also add ```-o``` and ```-p``` arguments to specify the name and path of the generated zip file, respectively. 

Finally we can unzip the environment at our machine without internet, e.g., 

```
mkdir -p my_env
tar -xzf my_env.tar.gz -C my_env
source my_env/bin/activate # activate the environment
source my_env/bin/deactivate # deactivate the environment
```
